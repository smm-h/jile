<ul>
<li>start the endeavor</li>
<li>get the contents of the code as a string</li>
<li>create a new list to put the tokens in</li>
<li>keep track of where (in which kept, if any) we are in the code</li>
<li>keep track of which character we are looking at</li>
<li>keep track of what portion of the code we have added all the tokens of</li>
<li>loop through all of the characters in the code
<ul>
<li>if we are not inside a kept
<ul>
<li>search for a kept to enter</li>
<li>get the character at the forward flag</li>
<li>if we have a kept that starts with that character
<ul>
<li>search all kepts that start with that character
<ul>
<li>figure out where the opener of that kept would end if it had appeared</li>
<li>if that opener can appear and does appear
<ul>
<li>we found our kept</li>
<li>so stop the search</li>
</ul>
</li>

</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>if we found a kept that we must enter
<ul>
<li>take whatever is before it, break it into tokens, and add them</li>
<li>enter that kept</li>
<li>add the opener to this kept</li>
<li>move the flag forward</li>
<li>everything until here is added so also move the backward flag</li>

<li>figure out where its closer would end if it had appeared</li>
<li>if that closer can appear and does appear
<ul>
<li>add the kept</li>
<li>also add its closer</li>
<li>move the flag forward</li>
<li>everything until here is added so also move the backward flag</li>
<li>exit the kept</li>

<li>move the flag over to the next character</li>

<li>when the flag reaches the end, not everything has been added
<ul>
<li>either a non-kept portion remains
<ul>
<li>break it into tokens and add them</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>or an unclosed kept remains
<ul>
<li>unless its closer is entirely whitespace,
<ul>
<li>attach a mishap to its opener</li>
