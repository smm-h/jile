[:back:](../readme.md)

Nilex is the study of [Nilic languages](languages.md) and [codes](codes.md) written in them. Languages [process](processing.md) codes and [make](making.md) things out of them. Processing is meant to be almost instant, whereas making may be slow. Making may fail violently, but processing must always fail gracefully using [mishaps](mishaps.md).

The two common processes that almost every language include are [tokenization](tokenization.md) and [grouping](grouping.md). Another general process is reading settings from [a language well-suited for formally expressing them](formalized-settings.md).

Nilex comes with its own CLI, [Codestack](codestack.md), that lets the user push objects, such as codes and things made from them, onto a stack. Codestack can also be used to [preview visual objects on the stack by invoking the Viewer GUI](../vis/readme.md).
