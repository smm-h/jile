# `jile`

[:back:](../../readme.md)

## Background

I used to be estranged with Java until a freelancing project forced me to learn it in-depth and except a few minor quarrels, love its object-oriented specification and conventions. From then on, Jile has been the rock on which I have build everything else. The word "Jile" is a portmanteau of the words Java and Nile.

The two main projects in Jile are **NiLEX**, which has a long history before my acquaintence with Java, spanning many years and many languages, and **Jilic Mathematics**, with no prior history before Java and Jile. Any other well-defined Java project that I take on will eventually become a part of Jile.

## Goals

- Remaining as pure as possible: relying as little as possible on standard and third-party libraries. Rational: hoping to one day be ported to Android.
- Interrelation: "playing nice" with each other, especially `common`, across projects. Reducing duplicate semantics.

## Packages

- [`common`](common/readme.md) utility methods, static functionality, basic data strucutres, and general interfaces that all other packages must "play nice" with
- [`nilex`](nilex/readme.md) the study of **Nilic languages**
- [`vis`](vis/readme.md) **visualization** of data structures and UI elements, and the necessary tools for "theming" them
- [`math`](math/readme.md) formalizing theories in **theoretical mathematics**
- [`cs`](cs/readme.md) material from courses taught in academic **computer science**

And coming soon,

- [`gm`](TODO), pygame-like wrapper over SDL, mimicing **GML semantics** to which I was once addicted
- [`therm`](TODO) deals with energy, mass and discrete time in the context of **thermodynamics**
