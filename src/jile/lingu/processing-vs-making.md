# Processing versus Making

[:back:](readme.md)

Despite their similarities, [processing](processing.md) and [making](making.md) have a few fundamental differences.

## Complexity

Processing is meant to be **almost instant**, whereas making may be **as slow as necessary**.

Implement most tasks as makers.

Optimize your processors.

## Error handling

Though making may fail violently and without explanation, all processing must always fail gracefully using [mishaps](mishaps.md).
